# Freeway - Game


Thiere is another game using JavaScript!<br><br>
I'm happy sharing this here.<br><br><br>

*HOW TO PLAY?*

To run p5.js in your computer you will need a text editor. You can use the
code editor of your choice. I usually use the Sublime Text 2. Other good editor
options are Brackets and Atom. If you are a screen reader user and not using the
p5 web editor, you may want to use Notepad++ or Eclipse.

After that, to play Freeway is simple! <br><br>



*Use the arrows UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT to move the cow*.



Hope you like and have fun!
